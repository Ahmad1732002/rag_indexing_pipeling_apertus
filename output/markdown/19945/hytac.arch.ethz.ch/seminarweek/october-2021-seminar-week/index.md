Seminar week – HS21
=====================

**First 3D printing of the first year students**
------------------------------------------------

Using 3D modelling software, students discover the concept of space and use their imagination in a new way. 3D printers are then used to make this a reality. They acquired the basic notions of these technologies during their first weeks of study in the HYTAC Basics course. Then, they printed their first models with the Prusa 3D printers during the seminar week.

In early November 2021, a large exhibition with more than 300 works was on display in the entrance hall of the HIL.
