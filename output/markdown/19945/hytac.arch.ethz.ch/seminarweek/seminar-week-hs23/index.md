Seminar Week – HS23
=====================



[https://hytac.arch.ethz.ch/seminarweek/seminar-week-hs23/](https://hytac.arch.ethz.ch/seminarweek/seminar-week-hs23/ "") by [https://hytac.arch.ethz.ch/author/fanny/](https://hytac.arch.ethz.ch/author/fanny/ "View all posts by ")

During the seminar week of the winter semester 2023, the first\-year architecture students deepened their knowledge of the basics of 3D modelling for architecture, acquired during the first weeks of the “HYTAC Basics” course and printed their first 3D models.

The students were all reunited in their big drawing room and received daily inputs on a broad range of topics.  
From CADing, Prusa Slicer Software, 3D printing for Architecture Design, Hybrid Modelling, etc. The format is interactive and balanced between inputs, exercises, small submission and direct feedbacks.

The motivated students, “Tech Profis” were also able to familiarise themselves with the new Prusa MK4 printers by building them from A to Z.

The HYTAC team, Doz. Jonathan Benhamu and student assistants are on hand during the week to support the first\-year students. They answer all their questions about software, hardware, architectural representation and how to connect all the elements to bring their ideas to life.

The first prints were launched on Tuesday, while overnight prints ran from Wednesday evening.

The aim of the week is in the end achieved: the bridge between the physical and the numerical, the analogue and the digital, to create something hybrid and unique between these two opposites is set. The students now have an overview of what can be done quickly and “simply” with their creativity and the support of technology.

The HYTAC exhibition took place the week after the seminar week to showcase students’ work ! You can have a look at it [here](https://hytac.arch.ethz.ch/exhibitions/exhibition-hs23/) !
