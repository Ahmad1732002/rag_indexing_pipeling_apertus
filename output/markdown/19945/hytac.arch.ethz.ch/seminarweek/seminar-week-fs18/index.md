Seminar Week – FS18
=====================



[https://hytac.arch.ethz.ch/seminarweek/seminar-week-fs18/](https://hytac.arch.ethz.ch/seminarweek/seminar-week-fs18/ "") by [https://hytac.arch.ethz.ch/author/fanny/](https://hytac.arch.ethz.ch/author/fanny/ "View all posts by ")

**First contact with the new machines**
---------------------------------------

The Department of Architecture decided to invest in a pilot initiative to allow 3d Printing to become part of the design process, so 100 3D Printers were donated by the Adrian Weiss Foundation.  
This first seminar focused on supporting the 300 first year students in building the machines and teaching them how to operate them in 2 intensive days. Some of them were able to produce small projects.  
The results prompted the Department and the Professor Deplazes to allow the initiative to continue as a Pilot Project, and simultaneously jump started the planning and building of the 3DLAB.
