Spring Semester 2019 – A. Deplazes
====================================



[https://hytac.arch.ethz.ch/collaborations/fall-semester-2021-b-dillenburger-2-2/](https://hytac.arch.ethz.ch/collaborations/fall-semester-2021-b-dillenburger-2-2/ "") by [https://hytac.arch.ethz.ch/author/fanny/](https://hytac.arch.ethz.ch/author/fanny/ "View all posts by ")

Based on the semester program of Professor Andrea Deplazes, the exercise was about developing a neighbourhood within a context made of pieces of diverse parts of European cities. A specific course was given to the students for them to be able to build the city using either 3D printing or conventional methods making them almost indistinguishable, allowing for each student to decide which method better worked for them.
