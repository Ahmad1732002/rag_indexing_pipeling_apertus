Fall Semester 2021 – B. Dillenburger
======================================



[https://hytac.arch.ethz.ch/collaborations/fall-semester-2021-b-dillenburger/](https://hytac.arch.ethz.ch/collaborations/fall-semester-2021-b-dillenburger/ "") by [https://hytac.arch.ethz.ch/author/fanny/](https://hytac.arch.ethz.ch/author/fanny/ "View all posts by ")

During the first weeks of Professor Dillenburger’s “Computational Design I” course, architecture students learn the basics of visual programming with Grasshopper, in parallel with the Rhino3D software, which is also used in the Hytac course.

During the seminar week of the fall semester 2021, the students made one of their Grasshopper parameterised models, a column, concrete by 3D printing it.  
This column was part of the work handed in at the end of the week.

In addition, the students were introduced to augmented reality, which can be used with everyone’s phone to see the column in 3D, virtually.
