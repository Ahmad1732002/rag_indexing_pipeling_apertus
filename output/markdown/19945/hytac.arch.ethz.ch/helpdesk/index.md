Cleaning Schedule
-----------------

The 3D Lab must be cleaned regularly so that everyone can work comfortably in it. That’s why we created a cleaning plan. Which will be hung up in the 3D Lab. Every Tuesday and Friday, two printer groups are assigned to ensure that the 3D Lab is clean. Please clean the floor and the windows, throw away the rubbish and tidy up the honeycomb wall with all it’s tools. At 8 a.m., we will check it to ensure that the 3D Lab has really been cleaned. If it is not to our satisfaction, we will withdraw the access to the 3D Lab for these groups for the rest of the year.
